## How it works
Stochastic Multiplier. Using bipolar representation, takes 2 9-bit streams as input and outputs the average product in 9-bits.

## How to test
Input 2 repeating streams of 9 bits that represent the numbers to be multiplied and output the result. May have to wait to check if result is accurate.
