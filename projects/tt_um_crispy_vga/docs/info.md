## How it works

This project "Crispy VGA" takes as input the output of a standard tiny tapeout VGA project.
Crispy VGA then adds a programmable amount of random noise to the VGA signal and passes it through to the output.


## How to test

Plug an existing tiny tapeout VGA project into the input of this design.
Plug the output of this design into a standard VGA input monitor. 

## External hardware

You will need a VGA input monitor and a tiny tapeout ASIC with a working VGA design that follows the standard pinout.
